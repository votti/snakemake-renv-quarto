# TODO

* Replace `votti` and `snakemake-renv-quarto` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `snakemake-renv-quarto` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `snakemake-renv-quarto-example` with the workflow name (can be the same as `snakemake-renv-quarto`).
* Replace `Example workflow how quarto and renv may be used.` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `votti` and `snakemake-renv-quarto` were correctly set.
